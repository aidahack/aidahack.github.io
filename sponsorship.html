AIDAHack reimagines the traditional hackathon, offering a two-month innovation sprint that mirrors real-world development cycles. Our theme, *Beyond a GPT Wrapper*, challenges UIUC's brightest minds to push AI boundaries beyond surface-level implementations. Participants can dive into any AI domain—from Vision Transformers to integrated agent systems—to create something truly groundbreaking. Drawing inspiration from UIUC's legacy of spawning tech giants like PayPal and YouTube, AIDAHack provides a platform for the next generation of innovators to shine. Through multiple development sprints, students will hone their skills, tackle complex problems, and bring sophisticated AI projects to life. By partnering with AIDAHack, sponsors gain unparalleled access to top-tier AI talent and cutting-edge projects, positioning themselves at the forefront of AI innovation and talent acquisition.
