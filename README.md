AIDAHack re-imagines the traditional hackathon, offering a two-month innovation sprint that mirrors real-world development cycles. Our theme, **Beyond a GPT Wrapper**, challenges UIUC's brightest minds to push AI boundaries beyond surface-level implementations. Participants can dive into any AI domain - from Vision Transformers to integrated agent systems - to create something truly groundbreaking.

Drawing inspiration from UIUC's legacy of spawning tech giants like PayPal and YouTube, AIDAHack provides a platform for the next generation of innovators to shine. Through multiple development sprints, students will hone their skills, tackle complex problems, and bring sophisticated AI projects to life.

For Sponsors: If you are interested in learning more about hosting a **Custom Track**, we work with the sponsor to design a project category of your choosing, fostering innovation in that area. (e.g. track requiring use of a provided API or tool, solving a specific problem, etc.). We have set a deadline of October 5th to allow teams sufficient time to ideate solutions to solve the problems put forth or learn to use the provided tools.
